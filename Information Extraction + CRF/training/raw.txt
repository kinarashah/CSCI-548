The fire was sparked Tuesday in San Bernardino County and spread to 37,000 acres by Friday, destroying at least 96 single-family homes and 213 outbuildings, fire officials said.

Skinner says earthquakes in Oklahoma are generally not directly caused by fracking, but rather by pressure from the disposal wells, which are used by the industry to get rid of the toxic waste water that comes out of the earth along with oil and gas.
The largest was at 7:02 a.m. (8:02 a.m. ET), with the preliminary 5.6 magnitude. The other quake magnitudes ranged from 2.7 to 3.6.
Other tremors in these fracking regions include a 5.3-magnitude quake near Trinidad, Colorado, in 2011 and a 4.8-magnitude quake near Timpson, Texas, in 2012.
Mount St. Helens erupted on May 18, 1980, blowing off more than 1,000 feet from the top of the mountain, leaving a huge crater and spewing hot ash across the Northwest. 
It killed 57 people, ignited forest fires from the scattering of hot ash and caused floods as the snow melted from mountain tops.
They were aftershocks from the massive earthquake that killed at least 654  people and injured more than 4,000 in the same area last month, according to John Bellini with the U.S. Geological Survey.

A smog outbreak in Southeast Asia last year may have caused over 100,000 premature deaths, according to a new study released Monday that triggered calls for action to tackle the “killer haze”.
The haze is an annual problem caused by fires set in forest and on carbon-rich peatland in Indonesia to quickly and cheaply clear land for palm oil and pulpwood plantations.
They estimated there were 91,600 deaths in Indonesia, 6,500 in Malaysia and 2,200 in Singapore.

Typhoon Nida has swept across Southern China , with the city of Guangzhou issuing its first-ever red storm alert and Hong Kong braced for flooding and landslides.
“It’s the strongest typhoon to hit the Pearl River Delta since 1983 and will bring severe flooding,” Xinhua cited local official He Guoqing as saying.
More than 220 flights out of Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai airports were cancelled before the storm passed over Tuesday, the Sohu news portal said.
Nida brought strong winds and torrential rains to the northern Philippines over the weekend, while southern China has already been hard-hit by storms this summer.

Flash flooding, which struck a swathe of southern and eastern England on Friday, is a greater threat to homes, roads and railways than river or coastal flooding.
Flash flooding was the principal cause of the most damaging floods in UK history, which in 2007 caused over £3bn of damage, caused 13 deaths and was classified by the Environment Agency (EA) as a “national disaster”.
A southbound train derailed after hitting a landslide near Watford Junction at about 7am.

Meranti, which grew in strength as it neared Taiwan, was carrying maximum winds of 134mph (216km/h), meteorologists said.
“This typhoon is the world’s strongest so far this year,” said weather bureau spokeswoman Hsieh Pei-yun. “Its impact on Taiwan will peak all day today.”
Tens of thousands of homes lost power across Taiwan as the island was hit by super-typhoon Meranti – a storm rated the strongest in the world so far this year.
